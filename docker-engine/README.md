# Docker Engine

The package for automatic installation of Docker Engine (CE) as a standalone node or a swarm member.

## Requirements

Before installing the package, please consider the following points:
* The appropriate Platform should run Jelastic of [5.2 version or later](https://jelastic.cloud/?versions=5.3_5.2) with the Native Dockers support enabled (i.e. it should contain an [environment region](https://docs.jelastic.com/environment-regions) with [Virtuozzo 7](https://virtuozzo.com/products/virtuozzo/) virtualization being integrated - the appropriate hardware set name(s) could be found within the dedicated column of the [Jelastic Hosting Providers](https://docs.jelastic.com/jelastic-hoster-info) list).
* In order to be successfully installed, the Docker Engine requires a [public SSH key](https://docs.jelastic.com/ssh-add-key) being added to your Jelastic account (whilst the corresponding private key should be handled at your local machine).
* The included option of [Public IP](http://docs.jelastic.com/public-ipv4) attachment is usually provided for billing users only, thus youâ€™ll need to convert your account beforehand.

## Getting Started

To create the environment, import the `manifest.jps` file using the _raw_ URL ([yeap!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toolscloud/deploy-jelastic/master/docker-engine/manifest.jps)), instead of the GitHub page ([nope!](https://github.com/toolscloud/deploy-jelastic/blob/master/docker-engine/manifest.jps)).

* Click on _IMPORT_:

* Paste the URL on the _URL_ tab and click on the button _Import_.

* That's it! Now, you just need to fill your information to Install the environment

**Important:** You can monitor what's happening behind the scenes, during the installation, on `/console` using the same URL from your provider, like this: `https://[your_cloud_provider]/console`. It's very useful also to test out your own cloud scripts.
